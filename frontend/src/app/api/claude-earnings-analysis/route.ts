The EPS of $${mockEarnings.last_quarter_eps} exceeded expectations of $${mockEarnings.expected_eps}, representing a meaningful beat that validates management's execution capabilities.

The ${mockEarnings.revenue_growth}% revenue growth demonstrates strong demand for the company's products and services, indicating market share gains and effective pricing strategies. This isn't just financial engineering - it's genuine business growth.

The fact that management raised guidance shows confidence in their ability to sustain this performance. When companies beat and raise, it typically signals that the underlying business trends are stronger than previously anticipated. This combination of earnings outperformance and increased forward guidance creates a powerful fundamental catalyst for continued stock appreciation.

The market reaction appears justified given the quality of these results and the positive outlook revision.`;
      } else {
        analysis = `${symbol}'s earnings results reveal some concerning underlying trends that warrant careful analysis. The EPS of $${mockEarnings.last_quarter_eps} fell short of the $${mockEarnings.expected_eps} expectation, indicating operational challenges or market headwinds.

The ${mockEarnings.revenue_growth}% revenue growth, while positive, may not be sufficient to maintain competitive positioning in this environment. This suggests either pricing pressure, market share erosion, or execution issues that management needs to address.

The earnings miss raises questions about forward guidance accuracy and management's visibility into business trends. When companies miss expectations, it often indicates that underlying business conditions are more challenging than previously communicated to investors.

This performance gap suggests the need for strategic adjustments or operational improvements to restore investor confidence and return to growth trajectory.`;
