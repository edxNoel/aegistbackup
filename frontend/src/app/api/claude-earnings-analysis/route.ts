The EPS of $${earnings.last_quarter_eps} exceeded expectations of $${earnings.expected_eps} by ${((earnings.last_quarter_eps - earnings.expected_eps) / earnings.expected_eps * 100).toFixed(1)}%, representing a meaningful beat that validates management's strategic initiatives.

The ${earnings.revenue_growth}% revenue growth demonstrates robust demand for the company's products and services, indicating effective market penetration and pricing power. This level of growth suggests the company is gaining market share and successfully executing its business strategy.

The fact that management raised forward guidance shows confidence in their ability to sustain this performance trajectory. When companies beat current expectations and raise future guidance, it typically signals that underlying business trends are stronger than previously anticipated and that the operational improvements are sustainable.

This combination of earnings outperformance and increased forward guidance creates a powerful fundamental catalyst. The beat validates the business model while the raised guidance suggests continued momentum, justifying investor optimism about future returns.

The market reaction appears entirely justified given the quality of these results and the positive outlook revision. This type of fundamental outperformance often leads to sustained stock appreciation as investors reprice the equity based on improved earnings visibility.`;
    } else if (scenario.type === 'miss') {
      analysis = `${symbol}'s earnings results reveal concerning underlying trends that warrant careful examination of the business fundamentals. The EPS of $${earnings.last_quarter_eps} fell short of the $${earnings.expected_eps} expectation by ${((earnings.expected_eps - earnings.last_quarter_eps) / earnings.expected_eps * 100).toFixed(1)}%, indicating operational challenges or deteriorating market conditions.

The ${earnings.revenue_growth}% revenue growth, while still positive, is insufficient to maintain competitive positioning in today's environment. This suggests either pricing pressure from competitors, market share erosion, or execution issues that management needs to address promptly.

The decision to lower forward guidance compounds concerns about the company's near-term prospects. When companies miss current expectations and reduce future guidance, it often indicates that management is seeing persistent headwinds that may take time to resolve.

The earnings miss raises fundamental questions about the effectiveness of current business strategies and management's visibility into market trends. This performance gap suggests the need for strategic adjustments or operational improvements to restore investor confidence.

The combination of missing expectations and lowering guidance creates a challenging narrative that typically leads to multiple contraction as investors reassess the investment thesis. The market reaction reflects legitimate concerns about the company's ability to execute in the current environment.`;
    } else {
      analysis = `${symbol}'s earnings results present a mixed picture that reflects the challenging operating environment many companies face today. The EPS of $${earnings.last_quarter_eps} essentially met the $${earnings.expected_eps} expectation, demonstrating the company's ability to deliver on commitments despite headwinds.

The ${earnings.revenue_growth}% revenue growth shows steady business performance, though not at levels that would drive significant multiple expansion. This represents solid execution in a difficult environment rather than exceptional performance.

Management's decision to maintain guidance suggests they have reasonable visibility into business trends but are taking a cautious approach given market uncertainties. This measured stance reflects prudent management rather than lack of confidence.

The results demonstrate operational stability but don't provide catalysts for significant outperformance. This type of in-line performance typically leads to sideways price action as investors await clearer directional signals.

While not disappointing, the results don't provide the upside surprise that would drive sustained appreciation. The market appears to be pricing in this level of performance, suggesting the stock may consolidate until new catalysts emerge.`;
